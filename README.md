This program allows you to change character colors in **Rivals of Aether 2** on **Linux**. 

## Requirements to Run:

Pillow

#### Fedora:
`sudo dnf install python3-pillow-tk`

#### Arch/Steam Deck:

* I am not in possession of a steam deck / arch distro, so this can be subject to change.

## Installation

   ```css
   ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Rivals 2/Rivals2/Content/Paks/Mods
